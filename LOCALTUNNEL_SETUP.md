## 🚀 How to Start localtunnel

### Option 1: Use the Batch Script (Easiest)

Double-click: **`start-localtunnel.bat`** in the root folder

This will:
1. Start localtunnel on port 5000
2. Show you the public URL
3. Keep running until you close it

### Option 2: Manual Command

Open a **NEW terminal** and run:

```bash
npx localtunnel --port 5000
```

You'll see output like:
```
your url is: https://funny-cat-12.loca.lt
```

---

## 📝 Next Steps

### 1. Start localtunnel

Run the batch file or the command above. You'll get a URL like:
```
https://random-name-12.loca.lt
```

**COPY THIS URL!**

### 2. Update Backend .env

Open `backend/.env` and update:

```env
BACKEND_URL=https://your-localtunnel-url.loca.lt
```

(Replace with YOUR actual URL)

### 3. Restart Backend

```bash
cd backend
# Stop with Ctrl+C if running
npm run dev
```

### 4. Verify Setup

Check backend console - should show:
```
🔗 Backend URL for tracking: https://your-localtunnel-url.loca.lt
```

### 5. Test the Tracking URL

Visit in browser:
```
https://your-localtunnel-url.loca.lt/api/track/open/test123
```

**First time**: You might see a page asking to continue. Click "Click to Continue"

**Important**: This page only appears in browsers, NOT in email clients! Email clients load images directly without seeing this page.

### 6. Send Test Email

1. Go to your dashboard
2. Send a new email
3. Open the email on any device
4. Check backend console for tracking logs:
   ```
   📧 Email open tracked: abc123
   ✅ Email open saved. Total opens: 1
   ```

---

## 🔄 If localtunnel URL Changes

localtunnel URLs change each time you restart. When this happens:

1. Copy the new URL
2. Update `backend/.env`
3. Restart backend
4. Send new emails (old emails have old URLs)

---

## 💡 Pro Tip: Use Custom Subdomain

For a consistent URL that doesn't change:

```bash
npx localtunnel --port 5000 --subdomain myemailtracker
```

This gives you: `https://myemailtracker.loca.lt`

**Note**: Subdomain might be taken, try different names like:
- `myemails123`
- `emailtrack2024`
- `yourname-emails`
